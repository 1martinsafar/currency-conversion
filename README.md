# Currency Conversion API and React APP  
Use `node app.js` to start the API server, port: 3000 by default (inside backend-api-currency-conversion)  
Use `npm start` to run the React using the create-react-app, if asked about port, type `y` (inside frontend-currency-conversion)  
Use `npm install` in each app's root folder to install the required project dependencies before running the apps  
The Frontend app is responsive/mobile-friendly and should work fine in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and IE  

# NOTE:  
The Frontend React is not "optimized" so that all the original code could be checked in its original form, create-react-app might suggest running `npm run build` to create the production build  

# + Ideas (with more time):  
=> For minification/concatenation etc. I could use `GULP`  
=> `Sass` could be used  
=> Could add EURO to the list of currencies - fixer.io API gets its data from European central bank, which only provides   those particular currencies   
=> Could add a visual warning when the input value is invalid  
=> Improve the visual design
