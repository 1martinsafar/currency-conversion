# currency-conversion
# Use `node app.js` to start the API server, port: 3000 by default
# Use `npm start` to run the React using the create-react-app, if asked about port, type `y`
# Use `npm install` to install the required project dependencies before running the apps
# The Frontend app is responsive/mobile-friendly and should work fine on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and IE

# + Ideas (with more time):
=> For minification/concatenation etc. I could use `GULP`
=> `Sass` could be used
=> Could add EURO to the list of currencies - fixer.io API gets its data from European central bank, which only provides those particular currencies
=> Maybe a list of popular destinations could be returned when there are more destinations with the same
popularity (though I think showing only 1 is probably better)
=> Currently on front end the display of the 3 stats is not dynamically refreshed after conversion -> the page has to be refreshed
=> I could add a visual warning when the input value is invalid
=> And also improve the visual design
